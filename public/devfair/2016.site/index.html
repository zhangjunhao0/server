          DevFair takes the traditional career fair and spins it on its head;
          rather than having companies set up booths that students can visit,
          we’re having groups of students set up booths to showcase their
          projects to recruiters. This science fair style presentation gives
          students the opportunity to show their potential better than a resume
          ever could.

          <h1 class="thin-text">Why?</h1>
          <p class="description-text">
          CSE students at UCSD are no strangers to job fairs. Sometimes, though,
          the scale of a job fair at one of the largest CSE departments in the
          country can get overwhelming. So, CSES decided to make something a
          little more personal. We want to give the best and the brightest at
          UCSD a chance to stand out; the result is our first annual DevFair.

            Been working on a really awesome project all summer? Find it difficult
            to fit it into your resume? Well we encourage you to take a look at DevFair!
            This is a fantastic opportunity for you (and your partners if you have them!)
            to showcase the best work you have to offer, and get rewarded with employment
            at a top company. At DevFair, you’ll be able to have a significantly more
            personal experience with recruiters than a traditional job fair, and we think
            it’ll help you not only find a company that’s a better fit, but also connect
            with recruiters that have a chance to really see what you’re capable of!

            DevFair is a recruiting opportunity unlike any other. Job fairs show you
            resumes, but those are only a small window into what a student has done.
            Hackathons can show you how students work under pressure, but they do a
            bad job of showing what students can achieve when given the time to create
            a truly finished product. DevFair can offer you new insight into UCSD’s
            best and brightest CSE students, by showing you what they’re truly capable
            of across a long period of time.
